# Debug Preset Thumbnail Issue

## Current Status:

- ✅ API returning correct image URL: `https://ultracard.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-20-at-3.51.51-PM.png`
- ✅ Shortcode parsing working correctly
- ✅ All other preset data working (author, tags, category)
- ❌ Image not displaying in preset card (showing person icon instead)

## What to Check:

1. **Refresh Ultra Card presets tab** - Image might be cached
2. **Check browser console** for any image loading errors
3. **Verify image URL** works by visiting it directly in browser
4. **Clear browser cache** if needed

## If Still Not Working:

Add this debug logging to see what thumbnail value is being set:

In `src/services/uc-presets-service.ts`, around line 385, add:

```typescript
console.log(`Setting thumbnail for preset ${wpPreset.id}:`, wpPreset.featured_image);
```

This will show if the thumbnail URL is being passed correctly to the preset definition.

## Expected Result:

The preset card should show your screenshot image instead of the person icon, with the "Default" badge and "Read More" button.
