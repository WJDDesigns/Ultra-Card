## Known Limitations (To Fix Next)

### 1. WordPress Dashboard Panel Queries

**Issue:** All backup type links show same data
**Reason:** Panel content doesn't filter by `$link` parameter
**Fix Needed:** Update `render_panel_content()` method to query based on link
**Priority:** Medium (cosmetic, doesn't break functionality)

### 2. Pro Tab Not Yet Added

**Status:** Tab name added to translations but tab not in UI yet
**Next Step:** Add Pro tab to editor with consolidated Pro features
**Priority:** Low (enhancement)

### 3. Dashboard Scanner Limitations

**Issue:** May not work with all HA dashboard configurations
**Reason:** Different HA versions have different Lovelace APIs
**Workaround:** Manual card backups still work perfectly
**Priority:** Low (edge case)
