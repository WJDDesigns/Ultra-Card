# 3rd Party Tab - Click to Add Implementation ✅

## Changes Made

### What Changed:

- ❌ **Removed**: Drag and drop functionality

- ✅ **Added**: Click-to-add functionality
- ✅ **Added**: Plus icon hint on cards
- ✅ **Updated**: Instructions to reflect click behavior

---

## How It Works Now

### 1. User Workflow:

**Step 1: Select Column**

- Click "Add Module" button on any column
- This opens the module selector AND sets which column to add to

**Step 2: Navigate to 3rd Party Tab**

- Click "3rd Party" tab (between Modules and Presets)
- See all installed custom cards

**Step 3: Click to Add**

- Click any installed card
- Card is instantly added to the selected column
- Module selector closes automatically

**Step 4: Card in Builder**
Once added, the card displays with:

- ✅ Drag handle (for reordering)
- ✅ Edit button (pencil icon)
- ✅ Duplicate button
- ✅ Delete button

**Step 5: Edit with Native Editor**

- Click pencil icon
- If card has native editor → Opens automatically
- If no native editor → YAML editor shown
- Configure and save

## Visual Changes

### Card Items in 3rd Party Tab:

- **Icon**: Plus circle (`mdi:plus-circle`) instead of drag handle
- **Cursor**: Pointer instead of grab
- **Interaction**: Click to add
- **Hover**: Border highlight and transform
- **Active**: Slight press effect

### Builder Display:

External cards in the builder look identical to other modules:

- Module card with icon and name
- Full set of action buttons (drag, edit, duplicate, delete)
- Same styling as other modules

---

## Error Handling

### No Column Selected:

If user clicks a card without first selecting a column:

- Alert shown: "Please select a column first by clicking 'Add Module' on the column where you want to add this card."
- User must select a column first
