# Quick Test Guide: Snapshot Fix v1.2.4

## 1. Upload the Fixed Plugin

1. Upload the updated `ultra-card-integration.php` to your WordPress site:

   ```
   Path: wp-content/plugins/ultra-card-integration/ultra-card-integration.php
   ```

2. **OR** if using FTP, replace the file directly

3. No need to deactivate/reactivate - changes take effect immediately

---

## 2. Delete Old Corrupted Snapshots (Optional)

Old corrupted snapshots (like #737) **cannot be recovered** because the corruption happened during storage.

1. Go to WordPress Admin ‚Üí Ultra Card Backups
2. Find any snapshots marked as "CORRUPTED"
3. Click "Delete" on each one
4. These were already corrupted and can't be fixed

---

## 3. Create a New Test Snapshot

### From Home Assistant:

1. Open your Ultra Card editor
2. Go to the **Pro** tab
3. Scroll to **Dashboard Snapshots**
4. Click **"Create Manual Snapshot"**
5. Wait for success message: ‚úÖ "Manual snapshot created successfully"

---

## 4. Verify in WordPress

### Check WordPress Backend:

1. Go to WordPress Admin ‚Üí Ultra Card Backups
2. Find the newly created snapshot (should be at the top)
3. **Verify it shows:**
   - ‚úÖ "Dashboard Snapshot" (NOT "CORRUPTED")
   - ‚úÖ Correct card count (e.g., "35 cards")
   - ‚úÖ File size showing (e.g., "421.52 KB")

---

## 5. Test Download

1. In WordPress backups list, find your new snapshot
2. Click the **"Download"** button
3. ‚úÖ **Expected:** A JSON file downloads (e.g., `ultra-card-snapshot-2025-10-03-161905.json`)
4. Open the file in a text editor
5. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Valid JSON with your card configurations

**If it fails:** Check browser console and WordPress PHP error logs

---

## 6. Test Restore (in Home Assistant)

1. Go back to Home Assistant
2. Open Ultra Card editor ‚Üí Pro tab ‚Üí Dashboard Snapshots
3. Click **"Restore"** on your test snapshot
4. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Success message with card count
5. ‚úÖ **Expected:** All cards visible in the dashboard

**If it fails:** Check browser console (F12) for error messages

---

## 7. Test View (Optional)

1. In WordPress backups list
2. Click **"View"** button on your snapshot
3. ‚úÖ **Expected:** Modal showing snapshot details and card list

_(Note: View feature may still show "coming soon" - this is separate from the corruption fix)_

---

## What Changed (Technical)

### Before (v1.2.3 - BROKEN):

```
WordPress stored JSON ‚Üí Added slashes ‚Üí Corrupted special chars ‚Üí ‚ùå Syntax error
```

### After (v1.2.4 - FIXED):

```
JSON ‚Üí Base64 encode ‚Üí WordPress stores safely ‚Üí Base64 decode ‚Üí ‚úÖ Valid JSON
```

**Base64 encoding** protects your Jinja templates and special characters from WordPress's automatic escaping.

## Expected WordPress Logs

If you want to verify behind the scenes, check your WordPress error logs. You should see:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Snapshot Still Shows as Corrupted

**Possible Causes:**

1. ‚ùå Old snapshot (created before fix) - **Delete and create new one**
2. ‚ùå Plugin file not updated - **Verify version 1.2.4 in WordPress ‚Üí Plugins**
3. ‚ùå Caching issue - **Clear WordPress cache, refresh browser**

### Download Returns 404 Error

**Possible Causes:**

1. ‚ùå Not logged into WordPress - **Log in first**
2. ‚ùå Wrong snapshot ID - **Click download from the list, don't type URL manually**
3. ‚ùå Permission issue - **Verify you're the snapshot owner**

### Restore Fails in Home Assistant

**Check Console (F12) for errors:**

- `Failed to decode snapshot data` ‚Üí Old corrupted snapshot, create new one
- `No snapshot_data found` ‚Üí Backend issue, check WordPress logs
- `Access denied` ‚Üí Login to Pro tab again

---

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

You'll know the fix worked when:

1. ‚úÖ New snapshot appears as **"Dashboard Snapshot"** (not corrupted)
2. ‚úÖ Download button works and produces valid JSON file
3. ‚úÖ Restore button works and restores all cards
4. ‚úÖ No "Syntax error" messages in console or logs
5. ‚úÖ Snapshot size shows correctly (e.g., "421.52 KB")

---

## Clean Up

After confirming everything works:

1. **Keep** `ultra-card-integration.php` (v1.2.4)
2. **Keep** `SNAPSHOT_CORRUPTION_FIX.md` (for reference)
3. **Optional:** Delete `diagnose-snapshot.php` (was only for diagnostics)
4. **Optional:** Delete old corrupted snapshots from WordPress

---

## Next Steps

Once verified working:

1. ‚úÖ Use snapshots normally - corruption is permanently fixed
2. ‚úÖ Manual snapshots will work reliably
3. ‚úÖ Auto-snapshots will work reliably (if Pro user)
4. ‚úÖ Download/restore will work for all future snapshots

**Note:** Old corrupted snapshots (#737 and earlier) cannot be recovered. They were corrupted during storage and must be deleted. Create new snapshots to replace them.
