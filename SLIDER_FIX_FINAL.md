# Slider Auto-Play Timing - FINAL FIX

## The Real Problem (Found via Logging)

Your logs revealed the **actual issue**: The timer was working perfectly at 1000ms intervals, but it kept getting **cleared and restarted** by event handlers!

### Evidence from Your Logs:

```
[SLIDER slider-1] Auto-play timer FIRED (1000ms interval)
[SLIDER slider-1] Slide change: 0 -> 1 (997ms since last change)  ← Perfect timing!
[SLIDER slider-1] Auto-play timer FIRED (1000ms interval)
[SLIDER slider-1] Slide change: 1 -> 2 (1003ms since last change)  ← Perfect timing!
[SLIDER slider-1] Timer CLEARED  ← PROBLEM!
[SLIDER slider-1] Starting auto-play with 1000ms delay  ← Restarting timer
[SLIDER slider-1] Timer SET (active timers: 1)
[SLIDER slider-1] Auto-play timer FIRED (1000ms interval)
[SLIDER slider-1] Slide change: 2 -> 0 (2832ms since last change)  ← Gap due to restart!
```

The timer was being **cleared and restarted**, creating 2-3 second gaps instead of consistent 1-second intervals.

## Root Cause

The `startAutoPlay()` function was **always clearing and recreating the timer**, even when called unnecessarily by:

1. **Manual navigation** (clicking pagination/arrows) - line 825
2. **Touch/mouse event handlers** (even when no slide change occurred) - lines 904, 968, 984
3. **Mouse leave with pause_on_hover** - line 1429

Every time these events fired, they would restart the timer, breaking the timing consistency.

## The Fix

Modified `startAutoPlay()` to **check if a timer already exists before creating a new one**:

```typescript
const startAutoPlay = () => {
  if (!sliderModule.auto_play) {
    return;
  }

  // Check if timer already exists - don't restart if it's already running
  const existingTimer = SliderStateManager.getTimer(sliderModule.id);
  if (existingTimer) {
    console.log(`timer already running - skipping`);
    return; // ← KEY FIX: Don't recreate timer if it exists
  }

  // Only create timer if one doesn't exist
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    nextSlide();
  }, sliderModule.auto_play_delay || 3000);

  SliderStateManager.setTimer(sliderModule.id, timer);
};
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

With the new build, you should see:

```
[SLIDER slider-1] Auto-play timer FIRED (1000ms interval)
[SLIDER slider-1] Slide change: 0 -> 1 (1000ms since last change)
[SLIDER slider-1] startAutoPlay called but timer already running - skipping  ← Good!
[SLIDER slider-1] Auto-play timer FIRED (1000ms interval)
[SLIDER slider-1] Slide change: 1 -> 2 (1000ms since last change)
[SLIDER slider-1] startAutoPlay called but timer already running - skipping  ← Good!
[SLIDER slider-1] Auto-play timer FIRED (1000ms interval)
[SLIDER slider-1] Slide change: 2 -> 0 (1000ms since last change)
```

**No more "Timer CLEARED" and "Timer SET" messages** during normal auto-play operation.

## What Changed

**File:** `/Users/wayne/Ultra Card/src/modules/slider-module.ts`

**Lines 998-1005:** Added check to prevent timer recreation:

```typescript
// Check if timer already exists - don't restart if it's already running
const existingTimer = SliderStateManager.getTimer(sliderModule.id);
if (existingTimer) {
  console.log(`startAutoPlay called but timer already running - skipping`);
  return;
}
```

## Testing

1. **Reload Home Assistant** to load the new build
2. **Watch the console logs** - you should see consistent ~1000ms intervals
3. **No more timer restarts** except when you manually pause/resume auto-play

## Previous Fixes (Also Applied)

1. ✅ Added initialization tracking to prevent multiple timers on re-renders
2. ✅ Added comprehensive logging to diagnose timing issues
3. ✅ **NEW: Prevent timer restarts when timer is already running**

This final fix addresses the actual root cause discovered through your detailed logs!
