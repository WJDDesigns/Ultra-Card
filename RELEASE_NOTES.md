## Version 1.2.0-beta6

### üéõÔ∏è Major Global Design Spacing Improvements

We've completely overhauled the spacing controls in the Global Design tab to fix several critical issues and improve the user experience:

#### üö´ Fixed Auto-Fill Behavior

- **No More Unwanted Auto-Fill**: When unlocked, typing in one margin/padding field no longer automatically fills all other fields
- **Individual Field Control**: Each spacing field now operates independently by default
- **Precise Control**: You can now set different values for top, right, bottom, and left margins/padding without interference

#### üîí Enhanced Lock Functionality

- **Perfect Value Mirroring**: When locked, the top field value (including units) is now correctly mirrored to all other fields in real-time
- **Unit Preservation**: Typing "10px" in a locked top field now correctly copies "10px" to all sides (not just "10")
- **Smart Lock Behavior**: Lock only affects the intended spacing type (margin lock doesn't affect padding and vice versa)

#### üìù Improved Input Handling

- **Full Unit Support**: All CSS units now work properly - px, rem, em, %, vh, vw, etc.
- **No More Input Blocking**: Fixed issue where certain characters couldn't be typed in spacing fields
- **Preserved Formatting**: Values you type are preserved exactly as entered (no more automatic conversion or stripping)

#### üîß Technical Fixes

- **Removed Hardcoded Padding**: Eliminated fixed 4px padding from info module entities - users now have complete control via Global Design
- **Fixed Value Processing**: Removed `parseFloat()` calls that were stripping units from spacing values
- **Resolved Template Conflicts**: Fixed reactive update conflicts that were overriding user input
- **Better State Management**: Enhanced lock state initialization and management to prevent edge cases

#### üí° How It Works Now

- **Unlocked Mode (Default)**: Each margin/padding field works independently - perfect for asymmetric spacing
- **Locked Mode**: Click the lock icon to enable synchronized editing - typing in the top field mirrors to all sides
- **Global Design Integration**: All spacing values now properly apply to module rendering with correct units

These improvements make the Global Design spacing controls much more intuitive and reliable across all modules.

## Version 1.2.0-beta5

### üñºÔ∏è Image Module Improvements

- **Unlimited Image Heights**: Removed the 800px height restriction on image modules
  - Users can now set images to any height they need (previously limited to 800px max)
  - Removed both UI form constraints and validation limits
  - Only maintains sensible minimum of 1px to prevent invalid configurations
  - Perfect for large banners, full-height images, or any custom sizing needs

## Version 1.2.0-beta4

### üì± Camera Module Responsive Improvements

We've made the camera module much more responsive and container-friendly:

- **Responsive by Default**: Camera modules now use 100% width by default instead of fixed pixel sizes
- **Stays Within Containers**: No more cameras overflowing their card boundaries
- **Smart Sizing**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes and layouts
- **Global Design Integration**: Full compatibility with the Design tab for custom dimensions
- **Maintains All Features**: Cropping, aspect ratios, and all existing functionality still work perfectly

**üí° How It Works**: The camera module now respects its container size while giving you complete control through the Global Design tab. The pixel dimension controls in the General tab are now fallbacks for specific use cases.

## Version 1.2.0-beta3

### üéØ Enhanced Module Spacing & Defaults

We've implemented consistent, professional spacing defaults across all modules to improve the overall visual experience:

- **Standard 8px top/bottom margins** applied to all modules for proper web design spacing
- **Improved visual hierarchy** and readability throughout the card
- **Better mobile and responsive layout** behavior across all devices
- **Consistent spacing** between modules regardless of type

**üí° Important**: You have **complete control** over these defaults! Use the **Global Design Tab** to:

- Override margins and padding for any individual module
- Set custom spacing values per module or globally
- **Remove default spacing entirely** if you prefer custom layouts
- Apply your own spacing preferences to match your dashboard design

### üîß Bar Module Improvements

- **Fixed Left/Right Side Labels**: Cleaned up the display when title fields are empty
  - **Removed orphaned colons** (":") that appeared when no title was specified
  - Now displays clean "Value" instead of awkward ": Value"
  - **Improved spacing** between title and value elements for better readability
  - Only shows the colon separator when there's actually a title present

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

- Enhanced conditional rendering logic for bar module labels
- Better default spacing system implementation across all module types
- Improved CSS organization for consistent spacing behavior
- More robust template handling for cleaner UI displays

## Version 1.1.0-beta3 (Separator Module Enhancements)

### New Features

  - Proper centering and alignment for both orientations
  - All separator styles work in both orientations (line, double line, dotted, shadow, blank space)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed separator visibility**: Improved default colors and thickness for better visibility
- **Fixed vertical separator centering**: Vertical separators now properly center horizontally
- **Fixed height limitations**: Vertical separators can now be up to 1000px tall
