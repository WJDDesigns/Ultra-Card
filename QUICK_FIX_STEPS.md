# üöÄ Quick Fix Steps - Snapshot Issues Resolved

## What Was Fixed

- ‚úÖ **Viewing snapshots in WordPress** - Now handles corrupted data gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Downloading snapshots from WordPress** - Already working from previous fix
- ‚úÖ **Restoring snapshots in Home Assistant** - No more "Cannot read properties of null" error

## Immediate Action Required

### 1. Upload the Fixed Plugin

```
/Users/wayne/Ultra Card/ultra-card-integration.php
```

Replace the existing file at:

```
wp-content/plugins/ultra-card-integration/ultra-card-integration.php
```

### 2. Restart the Plugin

In WordPress Admin:

1. Go to **Plugins** page
2. Find "Ultra Card Integration"
3. Click **Deactivate**
4. Click **Activate**
5. Verify version shows `1.2.2`

### 3. Test Immediately

1. **WordPress:** Go to Ultra Card Pro dashboard ‚Üí Should see snapshot list
2. **Home Assistant:** Open Ultra Card editor ‚Üí Pro tab ‚Üí View Snapshots ‚Üí Try restoring

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Working Snapshots

- Show card counts and view breakdowns
- Can be downloaded as JSON
- Can be restored with full card configs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Corrupted Snapshots (if any exist)

- Show as "Dashboard Snapshot (CORRUPTED)" or "INVALID"
- Show error message: "ERROR: Syntax error" or "ERROR: No data"
- Can be deleted (not restored)

### üìä Debug Logs

All operations now logged to `php_errorlog.txt`:

```
‚úÖ Snapshot 728 retrieved successfully: 35 cards
‚úÖ Snapshot 730 restored: 42 cards
‚ùå Snapshot 999 JSON decode failed: Syntax error
```

## If Issues Persist

### Problem: All snapshots show as corrupted

**Solution:** Database column might be too small

```sql
-- Check current column type
SHOW COLUMNS FROM wp_postmeta LIKE 'meta_value';

-- If it's TEXT instead of LONGTEXT, fix it:
ALTER TABLE wp_postmeta MODIFY meta_value LONGTEXT;
```

### Problem: New snapshots are immediately corrupted

**Solution:** PHP memory limit too low

```php
// Add to wp-config.php
define('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M');
```

### Problem: Specific snapshot won't restore

**Solution:** Delete it and create a fresh snapshot

1. The corrupted one can't be recovered
2. Debug logs will show the specific error
3. New snapshots should work fine
